- The default branch is [staging branch][staging-branch-github-link].
- Feature enhancements or defect fixes should not be committed to the default branch, they should be coded in feature or bug branches.
- Issues should be created for each feature or fix in the [QR Code Generator Workspace GitHub Repository Project][qr-code-generator-workspace-github].
- Pull request (PR) should be created for each feature/bug branch to [staging branch][staging-branch-github-link].
- While creating a PR "[Feature]: ", "[Bug]: " or "[Doc]: " prefix should be used to identify the PR type.
- PRs should be linked with a valid issue in the [QR Code Generator Workspace GitHub Repository Project][qr-code-generator-workspace-github].
- If validations are passed in the [staging branch][staging-branch-github-link], then a merge branch request is created with "merge branch" label & a linked PR to the [main branch][main-branch-github-link].

## Running the Application Locally

Application can be run with [QrCodeGeneratorBackendApplication][qr-code-generator-manager-main-class] class.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Gradle plugin][spring-boot-gradle-plugin] like so:

```shell
gradle clean build
gradle bootRun
```

## Running the Application in Docker

Application can be run in Docker. [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in the project root folder is the configuration file for Docker build.

```shell
docker build -t qr-code-generator:1.0.0 --build-arg APP_JAR=qr-code-generator-backend-1.0.0.jar .
docker run -p 8081:8081 --name QrCodeGenerator qr-code-generator:1.0.0
```
Note that you can specify the name of the APP_JAR argument based on the jar file that is generated by gradle. If the argument is not provided, it will pick the default name specified in the Dockerfile.

## Run Actuator

[Spring Boot Actuator][spring-boot-actuator] can be reached from [local url for Actuator][local-actuator].

Only health and caches endpoints are enabled by default. Configuration can be updated within the "actuator" section of the related application.properties file.

## Run Swagger UI
[Swagger UI][swagger-ui] can be reached from [local url for Swagger UI][local-swagger-ui] and [production url for Swagger UI][production-swagger-ui].

## Extra Notes

* The module can be booted with Spring Cloud Config Server or directly within the application. In order to boot the project within itself, enable the properties in application.properties file and disable bootstrap.properties file.
